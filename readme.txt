Project is currently built to function with libraries in C:/dev.
Project may not compile correctly if C:/dev folder is missing.
Necessary Libraries (glew, glm and SDL2) are included in this zip.
Please copy these folders as they are to a C:/dev folder 
(create dev folder in C drive if necessary)
in order for the project to compile correctly.
